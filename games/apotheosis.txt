This was taken from [an RPG.net thread on the topic](http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=282399). This is all Kasumi's work, I merely copied it here for personal archival purposes.

Exalted: Apotheosis is a toolkit for kicking off an Exalted campaign featuring a powerful and established circle of Solar Exalted PCs. It is intended for groups wanting to play characters who have already achieved great things in Creation, and are on the cusp of truly epic deeds. Apotheosis provides a framework for establishing the history of the circle, how their triumphs have changed the setting, and the conflicts that will shape their first few sessions of play, as well as presenting a streamlined and balanced character creation system for experienced Solars.

The default assumption of Apotheosis is that the Circle has, prior to play, achieved the equivalent of a medium length campaign (up to 100-150XP) or received advanced training (such as training provided by the Cult of the Illuminated). Mechanically it extends the material presented in Cult of the Illuminated for Exalted (first edition).

This toolkit works best with players already familiar with the Exalted setting and system.

## Setting Creation Afire ##

Starting a campaign with the Apotheosis toolkit gives you an approximation of the weight of conflict, personalised setting and player investment provided by actually playing through a short-medium campaign. That’s serious stuff! There’s two very important things you need to do to get the best results from the process:

1. Set aside an entire session for creating the campaign. This will include character creation, so give yourself several hours. Bring food!
2. Don’t have any ideas set in stone before the campaign creation session.

During an Exalted campaign, players become increasingly powerful as their characters’ ability to affect the setting expands. Games featuring powerful Solars are characterised by proactive play rather than GM-provided plot, hence the history of a campaign is usually an aggregate of player decisions. This is simulated in Apotheosis by making the creation of the campaign a group-consensus process rather than a GM mandate.

When you’ve gathered your group together for your session, go through the following process to create your campaign. It’s likely that your group’s brainstorming session will throw up ideas outside the Apotheosis framework – in that case, grab the structurally closest option and change its aesthetics, then make sure you have consensus on any mechanical adjustments you need to make.

While following this process, make sure you write down all your choices! However, try to avoid unnecessary detail – one or two sentence dot points for each choice should be plenty.

## Step One: Select Your Legend ##

As a group, choose one of the following Legends to reflect the achievements of the Circle to this point, and their current situation. This will affect the sorts of characters you can create (via the "Callings", which are packages of abilities and charms appropriate to the Legend), the resources available to your circle, and most importantly, provide inspiration for your other campaign creation choices.

### Reclaimers of the First Age [Crusade] ###

Exulting in your status as Solar Exalted, you have watered the land with the blood of the Wyld Hunt and brought a Creation-shaking legacy of the First Age back into the light.

Callings: Invincible Sword Princess, Prophet of the Unconquered Sun, Lord of the Three Circles

Resource Bonus: Shared Manse

### Enemies of the Dead [Crusade] ###

The Deathlord laughed when your Circle swore to destroy him. He raged as you burned away his Shadowland. He screamed as you hurled him into the Well of the Void.

Now his riches are yours, and Creation awaits your next move.

(This Legend is also suitable for Solars serving a Deathlord)

Callings: Castigator of the Dead, Prince of Shadows, Emissary to the Underworld

Resource Bonus: Artifacts

### Overlords of the Wyld [Crusade] ###

Let the Dragonlings have their Realm – you have carved out an empire from the lands of the Raksha, beyond the borders of the world!

Callings: Bulwark of Reality, Architect of Dreams, Envoy to the Shinma

Resource Bonus: Behemoth

### Bane of the Tepet [Direction (NE)] ###

As allies of the Bull of the North, you shattered a House of the Scarlet Dynasty, subjugated the Lintha, and subjected the mighty nation of Halta to the will of the Solar Exalted.

Callings: Icewalker Paragon, Haltan Commando, Marshall of Demons

Resource Bonus: Warstriders

### Kings of Ice and Sky [Direction (North)] ###

You have established your realm in the North, with armies flowing over the ice and Haslanti airships filling your sky.

Callings: Master of the Wastes, Queen of the Sky, Exemplar of Espionage

Resource Bonus: Airships

### The Scavenger Empire [Direction (River District)] ###

The Scavenger Lands, the most fiercely independent of all the lands of Creation, acknowledge you as first amongst equals. What mighty deeds did you achieve to win the respect of Lookshy and Nexus alike?

Callings: Solar Legionnaire, Shepherd of Kingdoms, Horse Lord of Marukan

Resource Bonus: Troops

### Protectors of Gem [Direction (South)] ###

You have raised your banner in the sands of the South, and shattered every doom that faced your city. Now you stand astride an empire of dunes, ready to take the offensive.

Callings: Dune-Forged, Seer of the Sands, God of Coin

Resource Bonus: Wealth

### Masters of the Waves [Direction (West)] ###

It’s true that your Circle rules many islands, but your real dominion is the reach of your fleet, and it is vast indeed. All the West knows your colours, and all Creation knows the tale of how you built your fleet from the ships of your enemies…

Callings: Wavecleaver, Unsurpassed Admiral, Tamer of Winds

Resource Bonus: Fleet

Cult of the Illuminated: Kether Rock

Callings: Architect, Deacon, Paladin

Resource Bonus: Illumination

Cult of the Illuminated: Sequestered Tabernacle

Callings: Exemplar, Inquisitor, Itinerant

Resource Bonus: Illumination

## Step Two: The Victors Write History ##

As a group, choose:

* **One epic change to Creation achieved by the Circle.** Your Legend will probably suggest what this is – the destruction of a Deathlord, the merging of the Scavenger Lands into a single Solar Empire, the reclamation of an intact First Age city etc. Pick an accomplishment that has a real impact on the setting, and when in doubt, err on the side of epic.
* **One faction in the setting that CANNOT IGNORE this epic accomplishment.** This faction will confront the Circle in the near future.
* **One faction which profits from the epic change.** This group is a source of potential allies and rivals.
* **One faction which is badly hurt by the change.** This creates a power vacuum in Creation, and a faction that may seek revenge.
* **Up to three factions or setting elements who are irrelevant to the campaign.** Pick the bits of Creation you don’t want to deal with, and quickly justify why you’ll never hear from them. For example: the Sidereals are so wrapped up in their factional conflict that they’re unable to meaningfully effect the events of the game. The Yozi would very much like to interfere, but can’t escape their bindings. The Autocthonians do not successfully contact Creation.

At this point, the group should have a rough idea of what sort of Creation they’re shaping. Are they excited? Is everyone keen, brainstorming up even more complications to add? Are cool character concepts inspired by the choices made so far spilling out of them?

If not, it’s the GM’s responsibility to shelve the particular idea for another time, go back to step 1, and start again. It’s critical to get everyone’s buy-in, to have everyone invested in the personalised setting you’ll be playing in. If some of the players are tepid, then it’s not good enough – keep cycling through ideas until you get something everyone is falling over themselves to play, even if it takes all night.

Once you hit that level of commitment, it’s time for the group to discuss character concepts. At this stage, rough ideas are fine – you just want a general sense of how they fit into the circle and its grand achievement. The better the fit of the Circle, the more conflict you can introduce between characters without derailing the game as a whole. It’s also worth emphasising that your concepts should be mighty and mature Solar heroes – you’ve already decided on an epic, setting-shaking deed they’ve accomplished, and your concepts should reflect that power and glory.

When you’re happy with the Circle you’ve sketched out, each player should make some choices individually. These choices are subject to group veto, and other members of the group should feel free to make suggestions (particularly refinements to an already good idea), but they are in the end ways for the player to put an individual stamp on the campaign.

Each player should choose:

* **One incident in which their Limit Break caused problems for another PC.**
* **One ally of the Circle.** This ally will be closest to the character of the player choosing them, but should have tension or conflict with another PC.
* **One enemy defeated by the PC.** This defeat will become relevant to future conflicts, as it’s an established element of your setting. Choose an NPC who you’re happy to have come back to haunt you (either literally, or in the form of allies, lackeys, curses or other consequences). Conversely, you get fame and boasting rights for the defeat, so don't hold back!
* **One living enemy of the Circle.** This enemy will have the greatest ire of the character of the player choosing them, but should have some sort of bond or positive connection with another PC.
* **An NPC who owes the PC a debt.**
* **An NPC whom the PC owes a debt.** These two debts should be roughly equivalent.
* **A major change to the setting.** This is a change on the level of a destruction of a city, a major shift in alliances, or the death of a powerful Exalted. While this should usually be the result of the Circle’s actions (particularly those of the PC in question), it’s not strictly necessary.
* **A minor change to the setting**. Mostly for colour and fun, this should be a tweak to the setting, such as an unexpected marriage, a change to the name of a city, or an important God being fired from their job.

You should now have one or more sheets of paper detailing your campaign’s customised Creation. Is everyone excited? Are their rich conflicts leaping out of the page? Will the Circle’s deeds be interesting from the very first session of play?

If not, go back and make changes until everyone is chomping at the bit – and if you can’t make that happen, go back to step 1 and start again.

If everyone is jumping up and down, it’s time to stat out those mighty Solars!

## Chosen of the Unconquered Sun ##

Creating a character for an Apotheosis game works a little differently to making a character of equivalent power under standard Exalted rules, but will be familiar to anyone who has read Cult of the Illuminated.

Under standard Exalted rules, characters can become relatively disadvantaged compared to other members of their Circle depending on how skilfully players have manipulated the character creation and advancement systems. This can be exacerbated at high XP, where characters that bought abilities up to 5 with experience fall behind those who maxed out their desired abilities at character creation. Furthermore, jack-of-all-trade generalist characters can become little more than sidekicks to their specialist circlemates as powerful deep-tree charms come into play.

Hence, Apotheosis character creation strongly encourages specialisation, and does away with XP in order to eliminate varying efficiencies in character builds. All creation and advancement in Apotheosis is done with bonus points.

### Step One: Choose Caste, Calling and Motivation ###

Caste and Motivation are as normal character creation, but it’s important that the Motivation be particularly epic – it is almost certainly your character’s SECOND motivation, since they would have achieved their first one during their rise to power.

Select a Calling from those available to your Circle’s Legend (the Callings are detailed in the next section). You may also select a Calling from another compatible Legend (if your Legend is Direction based, an appropriate Crusade, or vice versa. If your Circle is Illuminated, you may choose from another Cult Academy) at the cost of 6 Background points.

Your Calling represents an archetypal Solar role that you filled during your Circle’s great achievement, and that many of your previous incarnations also filled. It provides you with five abilities and fifteen charms that are particularly familiar to your Exalted soul, and that you can pick up much more easily (that is, you gain a steep discount on their cost). This is EXPLICITLY an incentive to buy as many of these abilities and charms as you can.

### Step Two: Attributes ###

Choose Primary, Secondary, Tertiary as normal. All Attributes begin at one dot as normal.

In your Primary category, set one attribute to 5, and distribute 5 points amongst the other two.

In your Secondary category, distribute 7 points.

In your Tertiary, distribute 5.

### Step Three: Abilities ###

Choose five Favoured abilities. At least three of your Favoured/Caste abilities must overlap with your Calling abilities.

Choose three Calling abilities that are also Favoured or Caste abilities. Set these abilities to 5, and choose 3 specialties for each.

Choose five more abilities that are either Favoured/Caste, Calling or both. Set these abilities to 3, and choose a specialty for each.

Distribute 10 more ability points as you please. Abilities may only be raised above 3 with bonus points.

### Step Four: Advantages ###

Select Backgrounds: 15 points, or 9 points if your Calling is not from the group’s Legend. Raising a background above 3 costs two points per level. Explain at least three of these backgrounds in terms of the great deeds of your Circle.

Select Charms: Choose 8 charms from your Calling, and 8 other charms.

Select Virtues: 7 points. At least one virtue must be rated at 4. Virtues begin at one dot as normal.

Select Virtue Flaw.

Select Combos: You have 5 bonus points with which to buy combos. You may save any number of these points for use in play, but they may only be used to purchase combos.

Select Intimacies: Compassion + 3

### Step Five: Finishing Touches. ###

Record Essence (3), Willpower (7)

Roll 1d10 - 1 to determine current Limit

Bonus Points: 21 points.

Costs: As normal, with the following additions:

Calling Ability: 1

Calling AND Favoured/Caste Ability: 2 per 1

Calling Specialty: 2 per 1

Calling AND Favoured/Caste Specialty: 4 per 1

Calling Charms: 4

Calling AND Favoured/Caste Charms: 3

Virtues: 2 points, but no longer affect Willpower.

Bonus Points may be saved to use in play.

### Advancement Notes: ###

In Apotheosis, characters are advanced by bonus points, using the costs normally associated with character creation, not XP. Wherever the system calls for the expenditure of 1XP, allow a "half point" to be spent. The remaining half can be spent on a Favoured/Caste or Calling Specialty, or the next occasion 1XP is required. For other miscellaneous XP costs, treat 1 bonus point as 2XP, with odd XP costs requiring a half-point.

### Improving Combos: ###

You may in play create an improved version of a combo you already possess. This costs 1 bonus point + 1 bonus point per added charm. You retain the original combo in addition to this new one.

## Callings ##

### Calling Charms and Excellencies ###

The First, Second and Third Excellencies, as well as Infinite Ability Mastery and Ability Essence Flow, are considered Calling Charms for a character in all of her Calling abilities. This may seem like an enormous number of charms to have at a discount, but there is generally diminishing returns from buying any more than two such charms for any given ability.

If your game uses further Excellency or support charms of this kind (whether from subsequent publications to the core or your own designs), they should generally be Calling charms if they represent alternate strategies to the corebook charms, rather than charms you’ll string together with them in uber-combos. You can pay full price for those

### Callings and Martial Arts ###

If Martial Arts charms are included in a Calling’s charm list, you may petition the GM to replace them with an equivalent number of charms from an alternative style. GMs shouldn’t reject such a request without good reason: these callings were written when very few styles were available, so the styles chosen for them shouldn’t be regarded as set in stone.

### Resource Bonuses ###

Your Resource Bonus is based on your Circle’s Legend, not your Calling. If you’re an Invincible Sword Princess that’s part of a Lords of Ice and Sky legend, you get airships, not a Manse.

### I don't like any of these! ###

At the end of the day, these are here to help you. Feel free to tweak, twist and snarl them as much as you like, so long as your group agrees that the end result fits the Legend.

## Creating your own Legend ##
I hope you’ve been inspired by the Legends and Callings so far. I had a lot of fun writing them (I really want to play a Wavecleaver or Marshall of Demons now).

But let me be clear: they’re not as good as the Legends and Callings you can come up with yourselves, IF you’re sitting around a table with your friends and collaborating. The brainstorm-style group session will beat one guy sitting alone at his computer every single time.

So, please, unless I’ve nailed the ideas you guys were having perfectly, make your own Legends and Callings. It’s easy.

### Legend ###

1. Quickly brainstorm a rough idea of what the campaign you’re NOT playing out – the one that took the Circle from 0XP to ~150XP – would have been about.
2. Make a movie poster for that campaign. Talk it out, sketch it out, huddle around Photoshop on someone’s laptop, I don’t care. Start with the name – that’s the name of your Legend. Remember to put the GM’s name in for Director and Producer – they’ll be running 150XP Solars soon, and they’ll appreciate the illusion of having once been in control.
3. Choose whether it’s a Crusade (more related to what the Circle was doing than its context in Creation) or a Direction (strongly flavoured by where you were).
4. Talk about who’d be on the poster in the "hero" poses. You don’t need to get too specific, because what you’re brainstorming here are ARCHETYPES (Callings), not your PCs (feel free to get inspired, jot some notes down, but don’t lock yourself in yet). Nail down the three ideas you’re most excited about – they’re your Callings.
5. Is there something about your poster that just screams one of the 25 Abilities on a character sheet? That makes that ability absolutely essential (like Sail for Masters of the Waves or Occult for Enemies of the Dead)? If so, agree on it and write it down – it’ll become a mandatory ability for each Calling.
6. Pick a Resource Bonus. This is both the pick of the loot the Circle won and their major tangible strategic advantage going into the new campaign. It should be mechanically expressed as a level 4 background with some major side benefits – for example, if it’s a Manse, it should be particularly secure. If it’s a vehicle, it should come with a fleet of mortal vehicles backing it up. Up the background to level 5 or equivalent if there’s a meaningful restriction (such as the Behemoth that doesn’t go anywhere for Overlords of the Wyld).


### Callings ###

This is the easy bit!

1. Name your calling. What sort of badass was that hero on the movie poster? Remember to riff off the Legend name.
2. Write out a quote. Ideally, this should have been their big line in the movie, the one used in the trailers to establish how awesome the character is.
3. Pick five abilities. If an ability came up at Step 5 of making your Legend, one will have been chosen for you. Otherwise, choose the five abilities that you feel really define the archetype. Try not to have more than 3 come from a particular Caste’s abilities – if you can’t imagine more than one Caste picking this Calling, it’s too narrow. If you can’t think of five abilities, your go-to defaults should be Dodge, Resistance and Integrity – solid defensive abilities with perfect defences, because they will assuredly be needed.
4. Pick charms (+ spells, if appropriate). You have fifteen charms. Stackable charms, like Ox-Body, count as 3 charms. If there’s diminishing returns to buying a particular set of charms (I’m thinking all three Countermagics here), every 3 of them count as 2 charms. Start at the bottom of trees and work up – it disadvantages characters to have the discounts floating later in the tree. Choose charms representing the solid, core competence of the archetype, preferably a set of charms that two characters could share and then branch off from without being locked into an identical niche (once again, starting low in the trees is good for this). Try not to go more than 7 charms for any given ability, but it is OK to have an ability with no charms, particularly for abilities like War where it’s just plain useful to have a high rating.
