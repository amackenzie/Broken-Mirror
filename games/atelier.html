<p>This is a puzzle game. The basic concept of the game is that the players have
access to an atelier, represented by a diagram resembling a circuit board.
Individual components apply properties to the output of the circuit, but
effectively using these components require proper use of intermediate systems
(similar to the roles of diodes, transisters, relays, and similar
constructions in electronics). Each of the intermediate components may also
apply or suppress effects that are passing through them.</p>

<p>The general effects that the intermediate components affect may be determined
by a construction similar to the Wu Xing, where certain elements are stoked
or suppressed according to a pattern.</p>

<p>The victory condition for each puzzle unit are a set of requirements for the
output. The output must maintain a minimum (and/or occasionally, a maximum)
power level, and will require certain effects above and beyond that.</p>

<p>Difficulty will scale by having more stringent power requirements on the
output; by requiring that the output require more special properties; and by
limiting the number of components available to the player.</p>
