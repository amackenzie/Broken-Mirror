# Changing the virtue system for non-Raksha games. #

One issue that many players came up with is the nature of the virtue system.
It works as presented, however, some aspects of it are not intuitive for
certain types of players, and so, here is an alternative means of adjudicating
virtue-type mechanics.

Start by scrapping the default compassion/conviction/temperence/valor tracks.
Instead, have each player pick 4-5 concepts core to their character. These
concepts can be embodied as people, ideals, or whatnot. For example...

* I wish to protect my father.
* I refuse to bow down to an opponent.
* My martial art is undefeatable.

One then assigns a 1-5 rating to the concepts that the players have picked.
The character in question must supress these concepts to take actions that go
against them. If the concepts are suppressed, the character's perfect defenses
that would otherwise suffer a flaw of invulnerability insteads takes a mote
penalty of 1 mote per suppressed concept.
