* Make sure tutorials are all turned on.
* Buying items off the market puts the item in the station you bought it in.
* Salvaging is not really worth it until level 3+ missions.
* Looting stuff is questionable as far as money-making goes. High-meta items
can sell quite well, but low-meta stuff is often worth more reprocessed than
sold.
* Certain enemies do specific types of damage. Adjust resistances accordingly.

Enemy damage types:

* Guristas: Kinetic/Thermal.
* Sanshas: EM/Thermal.
* Blood Raiders: EM/Thermal.

Some usual solo missioning progressions:

* Caldari: Merlin > Kestrel > Caracal > Drake. Then goes into Tengu, Nighthawk for cruiser-hull endgame, or Raven > Raven Navy Issue > Golem for battleship/marauder endgame.

Interface stuff:

* You can hold down shift when dragging a location out of people and places to make duplicates of a bookmark.
