## Struct Alignment ##

Structs are evil and don't necessarily add up to the size of the components.
There are speed benefits in terms of data access to having data in memory
aligned on certain boundries (usually the size of blocks that the computer can
pull out at once).

Alignment is not necessarily consistent.
It can be aligned anywhere on 2, 4, 6, 8, or wierder numbers, depending on the
processor and architecture.
