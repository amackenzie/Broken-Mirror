## Games Require ##

* Structure.
* Victory conditions.
* Understand why people do things - games need a reason to be played.
* Gives people a goal and reason to feel good about it - payoff was bad, or
too delayed, so that it didn't feel it was worth the trip.
* Part of the payoff should be the journey up. Payoff being the end goal
makes it have an, "Okay, now what?" feeling.

## Construction of Games ##

A lot of older games make up the fundamental pieces of what we play now.

Some games contain cultural transitions stemming back for long periods of
time. Example -- taunting sound for hide and seek/tag, etc.

Variations on games, ie, tag. Default rules: one person is it, tries to tag
someone else. Different victory conditions: don't be it, be the last person to
be tagged. More elaborate forms show up as well: zombies! Arguably, FPS
deathmatches are a form of tag too, but with longer range attacks.

Who makes games? People with time, safety, sufficient food, leisure time.
Naturally, a lot of games just grow out organically from children playing; it
tends to take someone in a position of power to be able to formally record
rules or such.

Once societies started specializing, more people started having more time they
could work in. ie, shepherds could spend time thinking about stuff while they
watched their sheep.
