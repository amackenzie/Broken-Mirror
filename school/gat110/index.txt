## Games Require ##

* Structure.
* Victory conditions.
* Understand why people do things - games need a reason to be played.
* Gives people a goal and reason to feel good about it - payoff was bad, or
too delayed, so that it didn't feel it was worth the trip.
* Part of the payoff should be the journey up. Payoff being the end goal
makes it have an, "Okay, now what?" feeling.

A lot of older games make up the fundamental pieces of what we play now.
