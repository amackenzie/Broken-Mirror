<h2 id="puttingafileintoastringinc">Putting a file into a string in C</h2>

<p>People ask about how to read files from their C text-based stuff. Easiest way
for small-ish files is to just stick the whole thing into a buffer into
memory. The rough code for doing that is something like…</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* File stuff. */
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; /* Memory management stuff (malloc!) */
#include &lt;string.h&gt; /* For memset(). */

FILE *working_file; /* Our file handle. */
long file_length; /* Can get very big. Use a long! */
char* buffer; /* This is where our data will end up. */

/* Note that the file is opened rb -- read, and in binary form.
 * The b tag is normally ignored by POSIX systems, but some Windows and
 * other odd compilers might have it make a difference. Better to use it
 * to keep things consistent.
 * If a non-absolute file path is given, it'll be relative to where the
 * program is run.
 */
working_file = fopen("/path/to/file.txt", "rb");
/* Set the seek point to the end of the file. */
fseek(working_file, 0, SEEK_END_);
/* Now to see how long the file is by checking where the seek is. */
file_length = ftell(working_file);
/* Put seek back at start of file. */
fseek(working_file, 0, SEEK_SET);

/* Allocate memory for the file based on the size. +1 for the \0.  */
buffer = (char*)malloc(file_length + 1);
memset(buffer, '\0', file_length + 1);
/* Time to actually read everything into buffer. */
fread(buffer, file_length, 1, working_file);

/* Close our file handle. */
fclose(working_file);</code></pre>

<p>This should work in most situations. It doesn’t check for errors, but that’s
easy enough – functions like fread and stuff return NULL if they run into
weird conditions, so just test for it and toss out an error message.</p>

<p>It’s probably also a good idea to free() the buffer that you created at the
end of the program, to release the memory used, though I’m not sure if the
compiler will do that for you automatically. Something to keep in mind, at any
rate.</p>

<p>This will give you a really big string (buffer) that contains everything in
the file, newlines and all. So if you want it in some other form, you can just
parse the buffer and do stuff to it or whatnot. It should already be in a
printable or manipulatable form. If you do not actually need it to be treated
as a string, leave off the extra +1 from the malloc, so that it doesn’t store
the terminating character.</p>
