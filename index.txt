## Various oddments! ##

[Currently playing stream](http://chaos.broken-mirror.net:8000/current.ogg). Contains whatever my music player at home is running. Isn't guarunteed to be on all the time.

This site is pretty much a placeholder until I can get something more
interesting up and running. There's a [blog](http://blog.broken-mirror.net) if
you're bored. I'm horrible at remembering to update it, though, so... eh.

Other things here are pretty much snippets of stuff I pick up all over the
place, and my notes on whatever I'm working on at the moment. It may be of
some interest to... someone. Who knows.

Also, yes, the weird typographic quotes and stuff sometimes don't show up
right on some computers. I'm trying to think of what to do with them.
