[Currently playing stream](http://chaos.broken-mirror.net:8000/current.ogg). Contains whatever my music player at home is running. Isn't guarunteed to be on all the time.

This site is pretty much a placeholder until I can get something more interesting up and running. There's a [blog](http://blog.broken-mirror.net) if you're bored.
